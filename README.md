Welcome to 36620B's code repository.

this branch is for our in-development Code for our robot, it is a separate branch as we might need to change port numbers or incorporate different methods of doing tasks that will not work with the main code and robot

this repository is for anyone to look at and judge the code (hopefully it's not too bad).
most of our code is in src/main.cpp and src/region-config.cpp. most other code is from the Purdue sigbots PROS and ARMS templates, as well as the branch name suggests LemLib developed by 1010N, so huge thanks to them for open-sourcing their code.
