Welcome to 36620B's code repository.

this repository is for anyone to look at and judge the code (hopefully it's not too bad).
most of our code is in src/main.cpp and src/region-config.cpp. most other code is from the Purdue sigbots PROS and ARMS templates, so huge thanks to them for open sourcing their code.
